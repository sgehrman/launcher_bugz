# launcher_bugz

### A buggy Flutter project.

### Flutter is WAY TOO BUGGY!! 3.22.x is a disaster!! Please fire the Flutter Technical Program Manager!

### launchUrl always returns false on Flutter web. Works fine on Linux. See console for print() output

### Flutter\'s quailty has really dropped. Have you given up on Flutter already?

### Unban my github sgehrman@gmail.com. Why do you ban people reporting bugs?

### 3.22.x has been buggy for over 2 months now and you refuse to post updates. Stable channel is not stable.
