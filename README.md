# launcher_bugz

## A buggy Flutter project.

## Flutter is WAY TOO BUGGY!! 3.22.x is a disaster!! Please fire the Flutter Technical Program Manager!

## launchUrl always returns false on Flutter web. Works fine on Linux. See console for print() output

## Flutter\'s quailty has really dropped. Have you given up on Flutter already?

## Unban my github sgehrman@gmail.com. Why do you ban people reporting bugs?
